If you remember the words of the deceased Arimba, tinilar tunila paida miterat trap 

He is to enable Gatotkaca to be a king of Pringgandani.
Durna is completely at odds with this decision. He thinks Gatotkaca is too young. And also, whose son is his?
Brajadhenta should be the one who should be king, not Gatotkaca. It is his right.
PLus, Gatotkaca's father killed Arimba.
I will provide my army.
