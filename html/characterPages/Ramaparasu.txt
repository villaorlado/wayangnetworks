<p><b>Description</b>: Son of Resi Jamadagni and Dewi Renuka. His father asks him to kill his mother, to punish her for committing adultery with Citrarata. He makes his father promise to grant him any wish. With this he returns his borthers to human shape (they had been earlier turned into animals for refusing to kill their mother) and to bring his mother back to life. Ramaparasu is angered when Citrarata kills Jamadagni and vows to kill kesatria. Eventually Rama (from Ramayana) kills him.
